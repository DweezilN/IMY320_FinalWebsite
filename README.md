There is a bug with our functionality

To enable mouse wheel horizontal scroll:
  Line 20 of Css needs to be enabled (position: fixed)
  Remove the attributes from the body tag in index.html
  
To enable NAV links and animation scroll
  Line 20 of CSS needs to be disabled (remove it)
  
 If you end up seeing a blue screen with navbar:
  scroll up to reach the top
  happens if you switch between functionality

Changes

The following changes were made from our proposal to our prototype:
- We decided to change the backgrounds from solid colour to images related to our game, since it creates more of a Game feel.		
- The navbar layout changed from being "Platforms" to a regular navigation bar.
- We changed our approach from mobile first to desktop, since our users will be playing the game from a desktop.
